# Oceanic Survival
A Minecraft: Java Edition data pack and resource pack that allow you to breathe underwater, but not in air.
			
* Note: Despite the use of the word "you," this works just fine in multiplayer.

### Installation
Step 1: Download this whole thingy.
Step 2: Go down into the directory structure of the ZIP file until you see a folder called datapacks and another ZIP file called resources.
Step 3: Copy datapacks/ and resources.zip into your world folder. (TIP: Creating a folder with these files in the .minecraft/saves/ directory and then creating a world of the same name will work, too!)
Step 3b: If your world already has a resources.zip file, you can just merge the assets folder from Oceanic Survival's resources.zip into the the world's resources.zip!
